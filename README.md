## Overview:
This is a website I am writing for the odin project. I got to practice
with html and css and see in real time what was altered while coding.
The project has been a great learning experience as I had to learn 
how to be self-sufficient when it came to having my questions
answered.

## What I learned
I learned how to make a website more interactive through the use of
flexbox. I've also become more familiar with css and how to make my
website more readable.
